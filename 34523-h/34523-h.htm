<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Aims of the distributional study here reported on concerning the fishes
of a part of the Arkansas River Basin of south-central Kansas were as
follows:</p>

<p>(1) Ascertain what species occur in streams of the three counties.</p>

<p>(2) Ascertain habitat preferences for the species found.</p>

<p>(3) Distinguish faunal associations existing in different parts of the
same stream.</p>

<p>(4) Describe differences and similarities among the fish faunas of the
several streams in the area.</p>

<p>(5) Relate the findings to the over-all picture of east-west
distribution of fishes in Kansas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>(6) List any demonstrable effects of intermittency of streams on fish
distribution within the area.</p>

<p>Cowley and Chautauqua counties form part of the southern border of
Kansas, and Elk County lies directly north of Chautauqua. The following
report concerns data only from those three counties unless otherwise
noted. They make up an area of 2,430 square miles having a population of
50,960 persons in 1950 (55,552 in 1940, and 60,375 in 1930). The most
populous portion of the area is western Cowley County where Arkansas
City with 12,903 inhabitants and Winfield with 10,264 inhabitants are
located. Each of the other towns has less than 2,000 inhabitants. In the
Flint Hills, which cross the central portion of the area surveyed,
population is sparse and chiefly in the valleys.</p>

<p>Topographically, the area is divisible into three general sections: the
extensive Wellington formation and the floodplain of the Arkansas River
in western Cowley County; the Flint Hills in the central part of the
area; and the "Chautauqua Hills" in the eastern part. The drainage
pattern is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>The Wellington formation, which is devoid of sharp relief, borders the
floodplain of the Arkansas River through most of its course in Cowley
County. A short distance south of Arkansas City, however, the Arkansas
is joined by the Walnut River and enters a narrow valley walled by
steep, wooded slopes. Frye and Leonard (1952:198) suggest that this
valley was originally carved by the Walnut River, when the Arkansas
River flowed southward west of its present course. They further suggest
that during Nebraskan glacial time the Arkansas probably was diverted to
the rapidly downcutting Walnut. The Arkansas River has a gradient of 3.0
ft. per mile in Cowley County. This gradient and others cited were
computed, by use of a cartometer, from maps made by the State Geological
Survey of Kansas and the United States Geological Survey.</p>

<p>Northward along the Walnut, steep bluffs and eroded gulleys characterize
both sides of the river, especially in southern Cowley County. Two
massive limestones, the Fort Riley and the Winfield, form the bluffs in
most places. The well-defined Winfield limestone is persistent on the
west bank of the river across the entire county. The Walnut has only a
few small tributaries in the southern half of Cowley County (Fig. 1). In
the northern half, however, it is joined from the east by Timber Creek and
Rock Creek. Timber Creek drains a large level area, formed by the eroded upper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
portion of the Fort Riley limestone, in the north-central
portion of the county. The gradient of Timber Creek is 12.9 feet per
mile. The gradient of the Walnut River is only 2.3 ft. per mile from its
point of entrance into the county to its mouth.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Map of Cowley, Chautauqua and Elk counties,

</div>

<p>Grouse Creek, like the Walnut, has formed a valley of one to three miles
in width, rimmed by prominent wooded bluffs. Those on the west side are
capped by the Fort Riley limestone with the resistant Wreford and Crouse
limestones forming lower escarpments. On the east side the Wreford and
Crouse limestones provide the only escarpments along the stream above
the Vinton community, except for occasional lower outcrops of Morrill
limestone. Below Vinton the Fort Riley limestone again appears, capping
the hills above the Wreford limestone. The headwaters of the western
tributaries of Grouse Creek are generally in the Doyle shale formation;
the eastern tributaries are in the Wreford limestone, Matfield shale,
and Barnestone limestone formations. The gradient of Grouse Creek is 9
ft. per mile, of Silver Creek 14.6 ft. per mile, and of Crab Creek 14.4
ft. per mile.</p>

<p>The Big Caney River (Fig. 1), having a gradient of 15.4 ft. per mile in
the area studied, drains an area with considerable geological and
topographic variation. The main stream and its western tributaries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
originate in Permian formations, whereas the eastern tributaries
originate in Pennsylvanian formations. Cedar Creek is exemplary of
western tributaries of Big Caney. This creek arises in the Wreford
limestone, as do several nearby tributaries of Grouse Creek. Although
the Grouse tributaries descend through only part of the Council Grove
group, Cedar Creek flows downward through the entire Grove, Admire, and
Wabaunsee groups and part of the Shawnee Group (Moore, 1951). In only 15
miles, Cedar Creek traverses formations comprising more than 60 per cent
of the entire exposed stratigraphic section in Cowley County. Bass
(1929:16) states that reliefs of 350 feet within a mile are present in
parts of this area.</p>

<p>Large terraces of limestone characterize the eastern flank of the Flint
Hills, which the western tributaries of Big Caney drain. Most striking
is the Foraker limestone. It characteristically consists of three
massive members in Cowley County, the uppermost of which forms the
prominent first crest of the Flint Hills. As the rapid-flowing western
tributaries of Big Caney descend over these successive limestone
members, large quantities of chert and limestone rubble are transported
and deposited in stream beds of the system. In many places the streams
of the Big Caney system flow over resistant limestone members, which
form a bedrock bottom. The eastern tributaries of Big Caney drain, for
the most part, formations of the Wabaunsee group of the Pennsylvanian.
Most of these streams have lower gradients than those entering Big Caney
from the west. The tributaries of Big Caney, along with length in miles
and gradient in feet per mile, are as follows: Spring Creek, 7.1, 54.5;
Union Creek, 6.3, 42.9; Otter Creek, 14.6, 27.4; Cedar Creek, 11.6,
31.0; Rock Creek, 15.9, 26.5; Wolf Creek, 9.3, 17.2; Turkey Creek, 8.5,
26.4; Grant Creek, 13.9, 23.4; and Sycamore Creek, 8.9, 27.0.</p>

<p>Spring Creek and Union Creek are short and have formed no extensive
floodplain. The high gradients of these creeks are characteristic also
of the upper portions of several other tributaries such as Cedar Creek
and Otter Creek.</p>

<p>Middle Caney Creek (Fig. 1) has its source in the Wabaunsee and Shawnee
groups of the Pennsylvanian but its watershed is dominated by the
"Chautauqua Hills" of the Douglas Group. This area is described by Moore
(1949:127) as "an upland formed by hard sandstone layers.&quot; The rough
rounded hills supporting thick growths of oaks differ in appearance from
both the Big Caney watershed on the west and the Verdigris River
watershed on the east. The gradient of Middle Caney in Chautauqua County is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
10.8 feet per mile. Its largest tributary, North Caney Creek, has a
gradient of 15.5 feet per mile.</p>

<p>The Elk River Basin resembles the Big Caney River Basin topographically.
Elk River has a gradient of 14.4 feet per mile.</p>

<h2>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF STREAMS</h2>

<p>The stream channels derive their physical characteristics from the
geological make-up of the area and from land-use. The Arkansas River
typically has low banks; however, in a few places, as in the NE &frac14; of
Section 21, T. 33 S, R. 3 E, it cuts into limestone members to form
steep rocky banks. The bottom is predominantly sand. In years of heavy
rainfall the river is turbid, but during 1956, when it occupied only a
small portion of its channel, it was clear each time observed. All
streams surveyed were clear except after short periods of flooding in
June, and except in some isolated pools where cattle had access to the
water.</p>

<p>In the Walnut River, sand bottoms occur in the lower part of the stream
but the sand is coarser than that of the Arkansas River. Upstream,
gravel and rubble bottoms become more common. Steep rocky banks border
most of the course of the Walnut. During 1956, stream-flow was confined
to the center of the channel, remote from these rocky banks.</p>

<p>The rubble and bedrock bottoms found in most streams of the Flint Hills
have been described. In the alluvial valleys of their lower courses mud
bottoms are found. Gravel is present in some places but sand is absent.
Banks are variable but often steep and wooded. Along east- or
west-flowing streams the north bank characteristically is low and
sloping whereas the south bank is high, rises abruptly, and in many
places is continuous with wooded hills. The lower sections of Otter
Creek, Cedar Creek, and Rock Creek fit this description (Bass, 1929:19)
especially well, as does Elk River near Howard.</p>

<p>Streams in the Chautauqua Hills resemble those of the Flint Hills in
physical characteristics, except that a larger admixture of sandstone
occurs in the rubble.</p>


<hr>
<h2>CLIMATE</h2>

<p>The climate of the area is characterized by those fluctuations of
temperature, wind, and rainfall typical of the Great Plains. The mean
annual temperature is 58 degrees; the mean July temperature is 81
degrees; the mean January temperature is approximately 34 degrees. The
mean annual precipitation is 32.9 in Cowley County, 38.5 in Chautauqua
County, and 35.1 in Elk County. Wind movement is great; Flora (1948:6)
states that south-central Kansas ranks close to some of the windiest
inland areas in the United States.</p>

<p>The area has been periodically subjected to droughts and floods. Such
phenomena are of special interest to ichthyological workers in the area.
At the time of this study drought conditions, which began in 1952,
prevailed. Even in this period of drought, however, flooding occurred on
Grouse Creek and water was high in Big Caney River after heavy local
rains on the headwaters of these streams on June 22, 1956. Some of the
lower tributaries of these same streams (such as Crab Creek and Cedar
Creek) did not flow while the mainstreams were flooding. This
illustrates the local nature of many of the summer rains in the area.</p>

<p>Something of the effect that drought and flash-flood have had on Big
Caney River is shown by the monthly means of daily discharge from
October, 1954, to September, 1956, at the stream-gauging station near
Elgin, Kansas (Table 2). Within these monthly variations there are also
pronounced daily fluctuations; on Big Caney River approximately &frac14; mile
south of Elgin, Kansas, discharge in cubic feet per second for May,
1944, ranged from .7 to 9,270.0 and for May, 1956, from .03 to 20.0.</p>

<h2>PRESENT FLORA</h2>

<p>The flora of the region varies greatly at the present time. Land-use has
altered the original floral communities, especially in the intensively
cultivated area of western Cowley County and in the river valleys.</p>

<p>The sandy Arkansas River floodplain exhibits several stages ranging from
sparsely vegetated sandy mounds near the river through stages of Johnson
grass, willow, and cottonwood, to an elm-hackberry fringe-forest. The
Wellington formation bordering the floodplain supports a prairie flora
where not disturbed by cultivation; Gates (1936:15) designates this as a
part of the mixed bluestem and short-grass region. <i>Andropogon gerardi</i>
Vitman., <i>Andropogon</i> <i>scoparius</i> Michx., <i>Sorghastrum nutans</i> (L.), and
<i>Panicum</i> <i>virgatum</i> L. are important grasses in the hilly
pasture-lands. Although much of this land is virgin prairie, the tall,
lush condition of the grasses described by early writers such as Mooso
(1888:304), and by local residents, is not seen today. These residents
speak of slough grasses (probably <i>Tripsacum dactyloides</i> L. and
<i>Spartina pectinata</i> Link.) that originally formed rank growths. These
no doubt helped conserve water and stabilize flow in small headwater
creeks. Remnants of some of these sloughs can still be found. The
streams in the Flint Hills have fringe-forests of elm, hackberry,
walnut, ash, and willow.</p>

<p>Eastward from the Flint Hills these fringe-forests become thicker with a
greater admixture of hickories and oaks. The north slopes of hills also
become more wooded. However, grassland remains predominant over woodland
in western Chautauqua and Elk counties, whereas in the eastern one-half
of Chautauqua County and the eastern one-third of Elk County the wooded
Chautauqua Hills prevail. This is one of the most extensive wooded
upland areas in Kansas. Hale (1955:167) describes this woodland as part
of an ecotonal scrub-oak forest bordering the Great Plains south through
Texas. He found stand dominants in these wooded areas to be <i>Quercus
marilandica</i> Muenchh., <i>Quercus stellata</i> Wang., and <i>Quercus velutina</i>
Lam.</p>

<p>Few true aquatic plants were observed in the Arkansas River although
mats of duckweed were found in shallow backwater pools at station A-3
(Fig. 2) on December 22, 1956. In the Walnut River <i>Najas guadalupensis</i>
Spreng. was common at station W-2. Stones were usually covered with
algae in both the Arkansas and Walnut rivers. A red bloom, possibly
attributable to <i>Euglena rubra</i> (Johnson), was observed on a tributary
of the Walnut River on July 9, 1956, at station W-4.</p>

<p>Green algae were abundant at all stations in the Caney, Elk, and Grouse
systems during May and June, 1956, and reappeared late in September.
<i>Chara</i> sp. was common in these streams in April and May.</p>

<p>The most characteristic rooted aquatic of streams in the Flint Hills was
<i>Justicia americana</i> L. At station G-7 on Grouse Creek and Station C-8
on Big Caney River (Fig. 3), <i>Nelumbo lutea</i> (Willd.) was found.
<i>Myriophyllum heterophyllum</i> Michx. formed dense floating mats at a
number of stations. Other aquatic plants observed in the Caney, Elk, and
Grouse systems included <i>Potamogeton gramineus</i> L., <i>Potamogeton
nodosus</i> Poir., <i>Potamogeton foliosus</i> Raf., <i>Sagittaria latifolia</i>
Willd., <i>Typha latifolia</i> L., and <i>Jussiaea diffusa</i> Forsk.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p>In 1857, a survey was made of the southern boundary of Kansas. Several
diaries (Miller, 1932; Caldwell, 1937; Bieber, 1932) were kept by
members of the surveying party, which traveled from east to west. These
accounts contain complaints of difficulty in traversing a country of
broken ridges and gulleys as the party approached the area now
comprising Chautauqua County. One account by Hugh Campbell, astronomical
computer for the party (Caldwell, 1937) mentions rocky ridges covered
with dense growth of "black jack,&quot; while another by Col. Joseph
Johnson, Commander (Miller, 1932) speaks of "a good deal of oakes in the
heights"&mdash;indicating that the upland oak forest of the Chautauqua
Hills was in existence at that time. On reaching Big Caney River near
Elgin, Campbell wrote of a stream with very high banks and of a valley
timbered with oak and black walnut. While the party was encamped on Big
Caney River some fishing was done. Campbell (Caldwell, 1937:353)
described the fish taken as "Cat, Trout or Bass, Buffalo and Garr.&quot;
Eugene Bandel (Bieber, 1932:152) wrote, "This forenoon we did not expect
to leave camp, and therefore we went fishing. In about two hours we
caught more fish than the whole company could eat. There were some forty
fish caught, some of them weighing over ten pounds.&quot; It was noted
that the waters of Big Caney and its tributaries were "very clear.&quot;
Progressing up Rock Creek, Johnson wrote of entering a high rolling
plain covered with fine grass, and crossed occasionally by clear wooded
streams (probably Big and Little Beaver Creeks and Grouse Creek). The
diary of Hugh Campbell (Caldwell, 1937:354) contains a description of
the Arkansas River Valley near the Oklahoma border. "The Arkansas River
at this point is about 300 yards wide, its waters are muddy, not quite
so much so, as those of the Mississippi or Rio Bravo. Its valley is
wooded and about two miles in width, the main bottom here, being on the
east side. On the west it is a rolling prairie as far as the eye can
see, affording excellent grass.&quot; Some seining was done while
encamped on the Arkansas River and "buffalo, catfish, sturgeons, and
gars" were taken (Bieber, 1932:156).</p>

<p>An editorial in the Winfield Courier of November 16, 1899, vigorously
registers concern about a direct effect of settlement on fish
populations in rivers of the area:</p>

<p>"The fish in the streams of Cowley County are being slaughtered by the
thousands, by the unlawful use of the seine and the deadly hoop net.
Fish are sold on the market every day, sometimes a tubful at a time,
which never swallowed a hook.</p>

<p>"The fish law says it is unlawful to seine, snare, or trap fish but some
of the smaller streams in the county, it is said are so full of hoop and
trammel nets that a minnow cannot get up or down stream. These nets not
only destroy what fish there are in the streams but they keep other fish
from coming in, they are not operated as a rule by farmers to supply
their own tables but by fellows who catch the fish to sell with no
thought or care for the welfare of others who like to catch and eat
fish.</p>

<p>"If there is a fishwarden in Cowley County so far as his utility goes
the county would be as well off without him and his inactivity has
caused many of those interested to get together for the purpose of
seeing that the law is enforced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>"Depredations like this work injury in more ways than one. They not only
deplete the streams of fish large enough to eat and destroy the source
of supply but if the U. S. Fish Commission discovers that the law is not
enforced and the fish not protected, there will be no free government
fish placed in Cowley County streams. It is useless for the Government
to spend thousands of dollars to keep the streams well supplied if a few
outlaws are allowed to ruthlessly destroy them. The new organization has
its eye on certain parties now and something is liable to drop
unexpectedly soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Graham (1885:78) listed 13 species of fish that had already been
introduced into Kansas waters prior to 1885 by the State Fish
Commission.</p>

<p>These early references indicate that direct effects of settlement on the
native flora and fauna were recognized early. Concern such as that
expressed in the editorial above persists today; however, it is not
clear whether the fish fauna of the streams of the area has been
essentially changed by man's predation. The indirect effects through
human modifications of the environment seem to be of much importance.
Three modifications which have especially affected streams have been
agricultural use, urbanization, and industrialization.</p>

<p>The effect of land-use on streams is closely related to its effect on
the flora of the watershed. Turbidity, sedimentation, and the rate,
periodicity, and manner of flow all bear some relationship to the
land-use of the watershed. Stream-flow in the area has been discussed in
the section on climate.</p>

<p>The effects of urbanization are more tangible and better recognized than
those of agricultural land-use. Streams that flow through cities and
other populous areas undergo some modification, especially of the
streamside flora. Another effect of urbanization has been increased
loads of sewage discharged into the streams. The combined populations of
Arkansas City and Winfield rose from 3,986 in 1880 to 23,167 in 1950.
Arkansas City found it necessary to construct a sewage system in 1889;
Winfield in 1907.</p>

<p>There are, at the present time, nine towns within the area that have
municipal sewage systems. The State Training Home at Winfield also has a
sewage system. The Kansas State Board of Health, Division of Sanitation,
has provided information concerning adequacy of these systems and
certain others in nearby counties as of February 5, 1957. This
information is shown in Table 3.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Division of Sanitation, Kansas State Board of
Health, expressed the belief that pollution by both domestic sewage and
industrial wastes would be largely eliminated in the "lower Arkansas"
and in the Walnut watershed by 1959.</p>

<p>Important oil and gas resources have been discovered in each of the
three counties. The first producing wells were drilled between 1900 and
1902 (Jewett and Abernathy, 1945:24). The Arkansas River flows through
several oilfields in its course across Cowley County (Jewett and
Abernathy, 1945:97). A number of producing wells have been drilled in
the Grouse Creek watershed since 1939 and many of these wells are near
the banks of the creek. In the Big Caney watershed of Cowley and
Chautauqua counties there has been little oil production in recent
years; however, a few small pools are presently producing in
southwestern Elk County.</p>

<p>Clapp (1920:33) stated that "Many of the finest streams of our state are
now destitute of fish on account of oil and salt pollution. The Walnut
River, once as fine a bass stream as could be found anywhere, and a
beautiful stream, too, is now a murky oil run, and does not contain a
single fish so far as I know. The Fall and Verdigris rivers are
practically ruined. Both the Caney rivers are affected, and may soon be
ruined for fishing.&quot; Doze (1924:31) noted "Some of the finest
streams in the state have been ruined as habitat for wild life, the
Walnut River is probably the most flagrant example."</p>

<p>Pollution by petroleum wastes from refineries has also affected the
streams studied. The only refinery within the area is at Arkansas City.
In Butler County there are four refineries on the Walnut watershed
upstream from the area surveyed. Metzler (1952) noted that "fish-kills"
occurred from the mid-1940's until 1952 in connection with wastes
periodically discharged from these refineries. However, the largest
kill, in 1944, was attributed to excessive brine pollution.</p>


<p>In Arkansas City a meat-packing plant, a large railroad workshop, two
flour mills, two milk plants, and several small manufacturing plants
contribute wastes which may figure in industrial pollution. There are
milk plants and small poultry processing plants at Winfield. In
Chautauqua and Elk Counties there is little industrial activity.</p>

<h2>CONSERVATION</h2>

<p>In recent years several measures have been implemented or proposed to
conserve the water and land resources of the Arkansas River Basin.
Droughts and floods have focused public attention on such conservation.
Less spectacular, but nevertheless important, problems confronting
conservationists include streambank erosion, channel deterioration,
silting, recreational demands for water, and irrigation needs.</p>

<p>Congress has authorized the U. S. Corps of Engineers (by the Flood
Control Act of 1941) to construct six dam and reservoir projects in the
Verdigris watershed. Two of these&mdash;Hulah Reservoir in Osage County,
Oklahoma, on Big Caney River, and Fall River Reservoir in Greenwood
County, Kansas&mdash;have been completed. Other reservoirs authorized in the
Verdigris watershed include Toronto, Neodesha, and Elk City (Table
Mound) in Kansas and Oologah in Oklahoma. Construction is underway on
the Toronto Reservoir and some planning has been accomplished on the
Neodesha and Elk City projects.</p>

<p>The possibilities of irrigation projects in the Verdigris and Walnut
River basins are under investigation by the United States Bureau of
Reclamation (Foley, <i>et al.</i>, 1955:F18).</p>

<p>An area of 11 square miles in Chautauqua and Montgomery Counties is
included in the Aiken Creek "Pilot Watershed Project,&quot; a co-operative
effort by federal, state, and local agencies to obtain information as to
the effects of an integrated watershed protection program (Foley, <i>et
al.</i>, 1955:131).</p>


<hr>
<h2>PREVIOUS ICHTHYOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS</h2>

<p>Few accounts of fishes in the area here reported on have been published.
Evermann and Fordice (1886:184) made a collection from Timber Creek at
Winfield in 1884.</p>

<p>The State Biological Survey collected actively from 1910 to 1912, but
localities visited in the Arkansas River System were limited to the
Neosho and Verdigris River basins (Breukelman, 1940:377). The only
collection made in the area considered here was on the Elk River in Elk
County on July 11, 1912. The total species list of this collection is
not known.</p>

<p>In the years 1924-1929 Minna E. Jewell collected at various places in
central Kansas. On June 30, 1925, Jewell and Frank Jobes made
collections on Timber Creek and Silver Creek in Cowley County.</p>

<p>Hoyle (1936:285) mentions collections made by himself and Dr. Charles E.
Burt, who was then Professor of Biology at Southwestern College,
Winfield, Kansas. Records in the Department of Biology, Kansas State
Teachers College at Emporia, indicate that Dr. Burt and others made
collections in the area which have not been published on.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>

<p>I am grateful to Professor Frank B. Cross for his interest in my
investigation, for his counsel, and for his penetrating criticism of
this paper. This study would have been impossible without the assistance
of several persons who helped in the field. Mr. Artie C. Metcalf and Mr.
Delbert Metcalf deserve special thanks for their enthusiastic and
untiring co-operation in collecting and preserving of specimens. Mrs.
Artie C. Metcalf, Miss Patricia Metcalf, Mr. Chester Metcalf, and Mr.
Forrest W. Metcalf gave help which is much appreciated. I am indebted to
the following persons for numerous valuable suggestions: Dr. John
Breukelman, Kansas State Teachers College, Emporia, Kansas; Dr. George
Moore, Oklahoma A&amp;M College, and Mr. W. L. Minckley, Lawrence,
Kansas.</p>


<hr>
<h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

<p>Collections were made by means of: (1) a four-foot net of nylon screen;
(2) a 10&amp;times;4-foot "common-sense" woven seine with &frac14;-inch mesh;
(3) a 15&amp;times;4-foot knotted mesh seine; (4) a 20&amp;times;5-foot
&frac14;-inch mesh seine; (5) pole and line (natural and artificial baits).
At most stations the four-foot, ten-foot, and twenty-foot seines were
used; however, the equipment that was used varied according to the size
of pool, number of obstructions, nature of bottom, amount of flow, and
type of streambank. Usually several hours were spent at each station and
several stations were revisited from time to time. Percentages noted in
the List of Species represent the relative number taken in the first
five seine-hauls at each station.</p>

<h2>COLLECTING STATIONS</h2>

<p>Collecting was done at stations listed below and shown in Fig. 2. Each
station was assigned a letter, designating the stream system on which
the station was located, and a number which indicates the position of
the station on the stream. This number increases progressively upstream
from mouth to source. Code letters used are as follows:
A&amp;Mdash;Arkansas River; W&mdash;Walnut River System; B&mdash;Beaver
Creek System; C&mdash;Big Caney River System; G&mdash;Grouse Creek
System; M&mdash;Middle Caney Creek System; E&mdash;Elk River System. All
dates are in the year 1956.</p>

<h2>ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES</h2>

<p><b><i>Lepisosteus osseus oxyurus</i></b> (Linnaeus): Stations A-1, W-2, W-3, G-2,
G-3, G-4, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-5, C-8.</p>

<p>Of 34 longnose gar taken, 27 were young-of-the-year. The latter were
from shallow isolated pools (bedrock bottom at C-1, C-3, C-4; gravel
bottom at C-6). At station W-1 in moderate flood conditions several
young-of-the-year were found in the most sheltered water next to the
banks.</p>

<p>The longnose gar was found only in the lower parts of the streams
surveyed (but were observed by me in smaller tributaries of these
streams in years when the streams had a greater volume of flow). A
preference for downstream habitat is suggested in several other surveys:
Cross (1950:134, 1954a:307) on the South Fork of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Cottonwood and on Stillwater Creek; Cross and Moore (1952:401) on the Poteau and
Fourche Maline rivers; Moore and Buck (1953:21) on the Chikaskia River.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepisosteus platostomus</i></b> Rafinesque: One shortnose gar (K. U. 3157) has
been taken from the Arkansas River in Cowley County. This gar was taken
by Mr. Richard Rinker on a bank line on April 10, 1955, at station A-3.</p>


<p><b><i>Dorosoma cepedianum</i></b> (Le Sueur): Stations W-3, G-4, C-4, C-5, M-1, E-1,
E-4.</p>

<p>In smaller streams such as the Elk and Caney rivers adult gizzard shad
seemed scarce. They were more common in collections made in larger
rivers (Walnut, Verdigris, and Neosho). In impoundments of this region
shad often become extremely abundant. Schoonover (1954:173) found that
shad comprised 97 per cent by number and 83 per cent by weight of fishes
taken in a survey of Fall River Reservoir.</p>


<p><b><i>Carpiodes carpio carpio</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3, W-3,
G-1, C-3.</p>

<p>Hubbs and Lagler (1947:50) stated that the river carpsucker was "Mostly
confined to large silty rivers.&quot; Of the stations listed above C-3 least
fits this description being a large shallow pool about &#8531; acre in area
having bedrock bottom and slightly turbid water. The other stations
conform to conditions described by Hubbs and Lagler (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>


<p><b><i>Carpiodes velifer</i></b> (Rafinesque): SBS. Three specimens of the highfin
carpsucker (K. U. 177-179) were collected on July 11, 1912, from an
unspecified location on Elk River in Elk County.</p>


<p><b><i>Ictiobus bubalus</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, G-1, G-2, C-1, C-3, C-4,
C-6, E-1, E-2, E-3.</p>

<p>The smallmouth buffalo shared the downstream proclivities of the river
carpsucker. In half of the collections (G-2, C-1, E-1, E-2, E-3) only
large juveniles were taken; in the other half only young-of-the-year
were found. In one pool at station C-1 hundreds of young buffalo and gar
were observed. This large shallow pool was 100 &amp;times; 150 feet, with an
average depth of 8 inches. The bottom consisted of bedrock. Station C-6
was a small pool with bedrock bottom, eight feet in diameter, with an
average depth of only 4 inches. Station E-3 was also a small isolated
pool with bedrock bottom and an average depth of 6 inches.</p>


<p><b><i>Ictiobus niger</i></b> (Rafinesque): Station C-5.</p>

<p>Only two specimens of the black buffalo were taken. An adult
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
was caught on spinning tackle, with doughballs for bait. The second specimen was a
juvenile taken by seining one mile below Station C-5 on September 22.</p>


<p><b><i>Ictiobus cyprinella</i></b> (Valenciennes): Station G-2.</p>

<p>Two juvenal bigmouth buffalo were taken in a shallow pool, along with
several juvenal smallmouth buffalo.</p>


<p><b><i>Moxostoma aureolum pisolabrum</i></b> Trautman and <b><i>Moxostoma carinatum</i></b>
(Cope): SBS.</p>

<p>Two specimens of <i>Moxostoma aureolum pisolabrum</i> (K. U. 242-243) and one
specimen of <i>Moxostoma carinatum</i> (K. U. 223) were taken from an
unspecified locality on Elk River in Elk County on July 11, 1912. There
are no other records for any of these fish in the collection area. <i>M.
aureolum pisolabrum</i> has been taken in recent years in eastern Kansas
(Trautman, 1951:3) and has been found as far west as the Chikaskia
drainage in northern Oklahoma by Moore and Buck (1953:21). That
occasional northern redhorse enter the larger rivers of the area here
reported on seems probable.</p>

<p><i>M. carinatum</i> has been reported only a few times from Kansas. The only
recent records are from the Verdigris River (Schelske, 1957:39). Elkins
(1954:28) took four specimens of <i>M. carinatum</i> from cutoff pools on
Salt Creek in Osage County, Oklahoma, in 1954. This recent record
suggests that occurrences in southern Kansas are probable.</p>


<p><b><i>Moxostoma erythrurum</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations G-5, G-7, G-10, G-12, C-4,
C-5, C-6, C-8, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-15, E-1, E-2, E-4 (C-131,
C-133, C-136).</p>

<p>The golden redhorse was common in several of the streams surveyed, and
utilized the upland parts of streams more extensively than any of the
other catostomids occurring in the area. <i>M. erythrurum</i> and <i>Ictiobus
bubalus</i> were taken together at only two stations. In no case was <i>I.
bubalus</i> taken from a tributary of Grouse Creek or of Big Caney River.
In contrast <i>M. erythrurum</i> reached its greatest concentrations in such
habitat, although it was always a minor component of the total fish
population. Stations C-5 and E-2 were the lowermost environments in
which this redhorse was taken.</p>

<p>The largest relative number of golden redhorse was found at station G-12
on Crab Creek where 7.5 per cent of the fishes taken were of this species.
This station consisted of intermittent pools averaging one foot in depth.
Bottoms were bedrock and rubble and the water was clear and shaded. The fish were consistently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
taken in the deeper, open part of the pool where aquatic vegetation, which
covered most of the pool, was absent.</p>

<p>Another station at which <i>M. erythrurum</i> was abundant was C-12 on Cedar
Creek. Here a long, narrow, clear pool was the habitat, with average
depth of 17 inches, and bottom of bedrock.</p>


<p><b><i>Minytrema melanops</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations G-10, C-4, C-12, E-1.</p>

<p>Occurrences of the spotted sucker were scattered. At stations C-4 and
G-10 single specimens were taken. At station E-1 (July 9) one specimen
was taken at the mouth of a small tributary where water was turbid and
quiet. This specimen (K. U. 3708) was the largest (9&#8540; inches total
length) found, and possessed pits of lost tubercles.</p>


<p><b><i>Cyprinus carpio</i></b> Linnaeus: Stations A-1, W-1, W-2, W-3, W-4, G-3, G-4,
G-6, G-8, C-3, C-5, E-4.</p>

<p>Carp were taken most often in downstream habitat. No carp were taken
above station C-5 on Big Caney River.</p>

<p>The earliest date on which young were taken was July 7, when 46
specimens, approximately &frac12; inch in total length, were taken from the
Walnut River at station W-1. The small carp showed a preference for
small shallow pools; adults were found in deeper pools.</p>


<p><b><i>Hybopsis aestivalis tetranemus</i></b> (Gilbert): Station A-3.</p>

<p>Only one specimen of the speckled chub was taken. The species has been
recorded from nearby localities in the Arkansas River and its
tributaries both in Kansas and Oklahoma. Its habitat seems to be shallow
water over clean, fine sand, and it occurs in strong current in
mid-channel in the Arkansas River. Suitable habitat does not occur in
other parts of the area covered by this report.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis blennius</i></b> (Girard): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3.</p>

<p>The river shiner was taken only in the Arkansas River and in small
numbers. In all instances <i>N. blennius</i> was found over sandy bottom in
flowing water. Females were gravid at station A-1 on June 14. To my
knowledge there are no published records of this shiner from the
Arkansas River Basin in Kansas. In Oklahoma this species prefers the
large, sandy streams such as the Arkansas River. Cross and Moore
(1952:403) found it in the Poteau River only near the mouth.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis boops</i></b> Gilbert: Stations G-5, G-7, C-3, C-5, C-8, C-9, C-10,
C-11, C-12, C-15, C-16, E-4, E-5, M-1, M-2.</p>

<p>Widespread occurrence of the bigeye shiner in this area seems
surprising. Except for this area it is known in Kansas only from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
the Spring River drainage in the southeastern corner of the state (Cross,
1954b:474). <i>N. boops</i> chose habitats that seemed most nearly like
Ozarkian terrain. The largest relative number of bigeye shiners was
taken at C-11 in a clear stream described in the discussion of <i>Notropis
rubellus</i>. At this station <i>N. boops</i> comprised 14.11 per cent, and <i>N.
boops</i> and <i>N. rubellus</i> together comprised 24.78 per cent of all fish
taken.</p>

<p>At station G-7 on Grouse Creek the percentage of <i>N. boops</i> was 7.15.
Here, as at station C-11, water was clear. At both stations
<i>Myriophyllum heterophyllum</i> was abundant and at G-7 <i>Nelumbo lutea</i> was
also common. At G-7 <i>N. boops</i> seemed most abundant in the deeper water,
but at C-11 most shiners were found in the shallower part of a large
pool.</p>

<p>Two other collections in which <i>N. boops</i> were common were from Spring
Creek. It is a small, clear Flint Hills brook running swiftly over clean
gravel and rubble. It had, however, been intermittent or completely dry
in its upper portion throughout the winter of 1955-'56 and until June
22, 1956. In collections at C-15 on June 28, <i>N. boops</i> formed 6.5 per
cent of the fish taken. Farther upstream, at C-16 on July 9, in an area
one mile from the nearest pool of water that existed prior to the rains
of June 22, <i>N. boops</i> made up 7.2 per cent of the fish taken.</p>

<p>In streams heading in the hilly area of western Elk County, the relative
abundance of <i>Notropis boops</i> decreased progressively downstream. On
upper Elk River percentages were lower than on upper Grouse Creek and
upper Big Caney River.</p>

<p>Hubbs and Lagler (1947:66) characterize the habitat of this species as
clear creeks of limestone uplands. There are numerous records of the
bigeye shiner from extreme eastern Oklahoma. It has been reported as far
west as Beaver Creek in Osage County, Oklahoma. Beaver Creek originates
in Cowley County, Kansas, near the origin of Cedar Creek and Crab Creek.
Drought had left a few pools of water in Beaver Creek in Kansas at the
time of my survey. The fish-fauna seemed sparse and <i>N. boops</i> was not
among the species taken. Of interest in considering the somewhat
isolated occurrence of the bigeye shiner in the Flint Hills area of
Kansas is a record of it by Ortenburger and Hubbs (1926:126) from
Panther Creek, Comanche County, Oklahoma, in the Wichita Mountain area
of that state.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis buchanani</i></b> Meek: Stations G-1, E-4 (C-131).</p>

<p>At station G-1 the ghost shiner was taken in small numbers in the
shallow end of a long pool (150 &amp;times; 40 feet.) The three individuals taken
at station E-4 were in an isolated pool (50 &amp;times; 510 feet) averaging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
1&frac12; feet in depth. Water was turbid, and warm due to lack of shade.</p>

<p>The habitat preferences of this species and of the related species <i>N.
volucellus</i> have been described as follows by Hubbs and Ortenburger
(1929b:68): "It seems probable that <i>volucellus</i> when occurring in the
range of <i>buchanani</i> occupies upland streams, whereas <i>buchanani</i> is
chiefly a form of the large rivers and adjacent creek mouths.&quot; The
results of this survey and impressions gained from other collections,
some of which are unpublished, are in agreement with this view. A
collection on the Verdigris River at Independence, Kansas, directly
downstream from the mouth of the Elk River, showed <i>N. buchanani</i> to be
common while <i>N. volucellus</i> was not taken. At station E-5 upstream from
E-4, however, <i>N. volucellus</i> was taken but <i>N. buchanani</i> was not
found.</p>

<p>In the upper Neosho basin, Cross (1954a:310) took <i>N. volucellus</i> but
not <i>N. buchanani</i>. Other collections have shown <i>N. buchanani</i> to be
abundant in the lower Neosho River in Kansas. Moore and Paden (1950:85)
observe that <i>N. buchanani</i> was found only near the mouth of the
Illinois River in Oklahoma and was sharply segregated ecologically from
<i>N. volucellus</i> that occupied a niche in the clear main channels in
contrast to the more sluggish waters inhabited by <i>N. buchanani</i>.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis camurus</i></b> (Jordan and Meek): Stations C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7,
C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, E-1, E-5 (C-131).</p>

<p>Highest concentrations of the bluntface shiner were found close to the
mouths of two tributaries of Big Caney River: Rock Creek and Otter
Creek. On Rock Creek (Station C-4) this shiner was abundant in a shallow
pool below a riffle where water was flowing rapidly. Many large males in
breeding condition were taken (June 3). The species formed 20.2 per cent
of the fish taken.</p>

<p>On Otter Creek (Station C-13) the species was common in shallow bedrock
pools below riffles. It formed 12.1 per cent of the fish taken.</p>

<p>At station C-5, <i>N. camurus</i> was characteristically found in an area of
shallow pools and riffles. At station C-10 it was found in clear flowing
water over rubble bottom and in small coves over mud bottom. At C-11
(July 26) <i>N. camurus</i> was taken only in one small pool with rapidly
flowing water below a riffle. In this pool <i>N. camurus</i> was the dominant
fish. At station C-12, on April 2, <i>N. camurus</i> was abundant in the
stream, which was then clear and flowing. On August 24, it was not taken
from the same pool, which was then turbid and drying.</p>

<p>The frequent occurrence of this species in clear, flowing water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
seems significant. Cross (1954a:309) notes that the bluntface shiner prefers
moderately fast, clear water. Hall (1952:57) found <i>N. camurus</i> only in
upland tributaries east of Grand River and not in lowland tributaries
west of the river. Moore and Buck (1953:22) took this species in the
Chikaskia River, which was at that time a clear, flowing stream. They
noted that in Oklahoma it seems to be found only in relatively clear
water.</p>

<p><i>N. camurus</i> did not seem to ascend the smaller tributaries of Big Caney
River as did <i>N. rubellus</i> and <i>N. boops</i> even when these tributaries
were flowing.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis deliciosus missuriensis</i></b> (Cope): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3, W-1,
W-2, W-3 (C-136).</p>

<p>Sand shiners seemed to be abundant in the Arkansas River, rare in the
Walnut River and absent from other streams surveyed. This shiner was
most abundant in shallow, flowing water in the Arkansas River; in
backwaters, where <i>Gambusia affinis</i> prevailed, <i>N. deliciosus</i> formed
only a small percentage of the fish population.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis girardi</i></b> Hubbs and Ortenburger: Stations A-2 and A-3.</p>

<p>At station A-2 the Arkansas River shiner made up 14.6 per cent of all
fish taken. At A-2, it was found only in rapidly-flowing water over
clean sand in the main channels. It was absent from the shallow,
slowly-flowing water where <i>N. deliciosus missuriensis</i> was abundant. At
A-3 <i>N. girardi</i> made up 22 per cent of the total catch, and again
preferred the deeper, faster water over clean-swept sand. Failure to
find <i>N. girardi</i> at station A-1 is not understood.</p>

<p>Females were gravid in both collections (August 25 and 27). In neither
collection were young-of-the-year taken. Moore (1944:210) has suggested
that <i>N. girardi</i> requires periods of high water and turbidity to spawn.
Additional collecting was done at station A-3 on December 22, 1957. A
few adults were taken in flowing water but no young were found.</p>

<p>In this area, <i>N. girardi</i> showed no tendency to ascend tributaries of
the Arkansas River. Not far to the west, however, this pattern changes
as shown by Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929a:32) who took this fish at seven
of ten stations on the Cimarron, Canadian, and Salt Fork of the
Arkansas. <i>N. girardi</i> was taken only in the lowermost stations on both
Stillwater Creek (Cross, 1950:136) and the Chikaskia River (Moore and
Buck, 1953:22). In the next major stream west of the Chikaskia, the
Medicine River, <i>N. girardi</i> seems to occur farther upstream than in the
Chikaskia. (Collection C-5-51 by Dr. A. B. Leonard and Dr. Frank B.
Cross on Elm Creek near Medicine Lodge on July 20, 1951.)</p>

<p><b><i>Notropis lutrensis</i></b> (Baird and Girard): Stations A-1, A-2, W-1, W-2,
W-3, W-4, G-1, G-2, G-4, G-5, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-11, G-12, G-13, G-14,
G-15, G-16, B-1, B-2, B-3, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-9, C-10,
C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, M-1, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-7 (E&amp;F, C-131, C-133,
C-136).</p>

<p>The red shiner was taken in every stream surveyed. The relative
abundance seemed to be greatest in two types of habitat which were
separated geographically. The first habitat was in large rivers such as
the Arkansas and Walnut. In the Arkansas River the red shiner
consistently made up 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the catch. On the
Walnut River percentages ranged from 10 per cent (station W-3) to 45 per
cent (station W-2).</p>

<p>The second habitat in which numbers of <i>N. lutrensis</i> reached high
proportions was in the upper parts of the most intermittent tributaries.
At the uppermost station in Silver Creek this species formed 30 per cent
of the fish taken. In Crab Creek the following percentages were taken in
six collections from mouth to source: 20.6%, 26.1%, 25%, 85%, 14.6%, and
1%. In the mainstream of Grouse Creek the highest percentage taken was
19.27 near the mouth at station G-1. In middle sections of Grouse Creek
this species was either absent or made up less than 2 per cent of the
fish taken.</p>

<p>At no station on Big Caney River was the red shiner abundant. The
smallest relative numbers were found at upstream stations, in contrast
to collections made on tributaries of Grouse Creek. This distributional
pattern possibly may be explained by the severe conditions under which
fish have been forced to live in the upper tributaries of Grouse Creek.
Water was more turbid, and pools were smaller than in Big Caney. These
factors possibly decimate numbers of the less hardy species permitting
expansion by more adaptable species, among which seems to be <i>N.
lutrensis</i>. In the upper tributaries of Big Caney River conditions have
not been so severe due to greater flow from springs and less cultivation
of the watershed in most places. Under such conditions <i>N. lutrensis</i>
seems to remain a minor faunal constituent.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis percobromus</i></b> (Cope): Stations A-1, A-2, W-1, W-2, W-3, G-1.</p>

<p>At station W-1 the plains shiner constituted 20 per cent of the fish
taken. The river was flowing rapidly with large volume at the time of
this collection, and all specimens were taken near the bank in
comparatively quiet water over gravel bottom. At station W-3, below
Tunnel Mill Dam at Winfield, <i>N. percobromus</i> comprised 18.7 per cent of
the fish taken, second only to <i>Lepomis humilis</i> in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
relative abundance. Immediately below the west end of the dam, plains shiners
were so concentrated that fifty or more were taken in one haul of a four-foot
nylon net. The amount of water overflowing the dam at this point was
slight. Water was shallow (8-12 inches) and the bottom consisted of the
pitted apron or of fine gravel. At the east end of the dam where water
was deeper (1-3 feet) and the flow over the dam greater, large numbers
of <i>Lepomis humilis</i> were taken while <i>N. percobromus</i> was rare.</p>

<p>In the Arkansas River smaller relative numbers of this shiner were
obtained. At station A-2, it formed 4.68 per cent of the total. At this
station <i>N. percobromus</i> was taken with <i>N. lutrensis</i> in water about 18
inches deep next to a bank where the current was sluggish and tangled
roots and detritus offered some shelter.</p>

<p>At station G-1 on Grouse Creek the plains shiner made up 7.68 per cent
of the fish taken. The habitat consisted of intermittent pools with
rubble bottoms at this station, which was four miles upstream from the
mouth of the creek. The plains shiner seems rarely to ascend the upland
streams of the area.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis rubellus</i></b> (Agassiz): Stations C-3, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-10,
C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14 (J&amp;J).</p>

<p>No fish in these collections showed a more persistent preference than
<i>Notropis rubellus</i> for clear, cool streams. All collections of the
rosyface shiner were in the Big Caney River system, but at only four
stations in this system was it common. At station C-11 the highest
relative numbers (10.6 per cent) were obtained. This site possessed the
most limpid water of any station on the mainstream of Big Caney. Aquatic
plants (<i>Myriophyllum heterophyllum</i> and <i>Potamogeton nodosus</i>) were
common. Other fishes that flourished at this station were <i>N. boops</i>,
<i>N. camurus</i>, <i>Campostoma anomalum</i>, and <i>Etheostoma spectabile</i>. The
water temperature was 86&amp;deg; at surface and 80&amp;deg; at bottom whereas air
temperature was 97&amp;deg;.</p>

<p><i>N. rubellus</i> was common at all stations in Otter Creek, the clear,
upland character of which has been discussed. In May and June only
adults were found. On September 1, examination of several pools in upper
Otter Creek revealed numerous young-of-the-year in small spring-fed
pools.</p>

<p>Literature is scarce concerning this shiner in Kansas. Cross (1954a:308)
stated that it was abundant in the South Fork of the Cottonwood River
and was one of those fishes primarily associated with the Ozarkian
fauna, rather than with the fauna of the plains. Elliott (1947) found
<i>N. rubellus</i> in Spring Creek, a tributary of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
Fall River which seems similar to Otter Creek in physical features. Between
the Fall River and Big Caney River systems is the Elk River, from which there
is no record of the rosyface shiner. Perhaps its absence is related to the
intermittent condition of this stream at present. The Elk River is poor
in spring-fed tributaries, which seem to be favorite environs of the
rosyface shiner.</p>

<p><i>N. rubellus</i> was taken by Minna Jewell and Frank Jobes in Silver Creek
on June 30, 1925 (UMMZ 67818). The shiner was not found in any stream
west of the Big Caney system in my collections.</p>

<p>In Oklahoma, Hall (1952:57) found <i>N. rubellus</i> in upland tributaries on
the east side of Grand River and not in the lowland tributaries on the
west side. Martin and Campbell (1953:51) characterize <i>N. rubellus</i> as
preferring riffle channels in moderate to fast current in the Black
River, Missouri. It is the only species so characterized by them which
was taken in my collections. Moore and Paden (1950:84) state &quot;<i>Notropis
rubellus</i> is one of the most abundant fishes of the Illinois River,
being found in all habitats but showing a distinct preference for fast
water....&quot;</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis topeka</i></b> (Gilbert): Two specimens (formerly Indiana University
4605) of the Topeka shiner labeled "Winfield, Kansas" are now at the
University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Collector and other data are
not given. Evermann and Fordice (1886:185) noted that two specimens of
<i>N. topeka</i> were taken from Sand Creek near Newton in Harvey County, but
do not list it from Cowley County near Winfield. They deposited their
fish in the museum of Indiana University.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis umbratilis</i></b> (Girard): Stations G-1, G-3, G-4, G-7, G-8, G-9,
G-12, G-14, B-2, B-3, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10,
C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5, M-1, M-2 (J&amp;J,
C-131, C-132).</p>

<p>The redfin shiner flourished in all the streams surveyed except the
Arkansas and Walnut Rivers. <i>N. umbratilis</i> has been found in upland
tributaries of the Walnut River, some of which originate in terrain
similar to that in which Elk River, Big Caney River, and Grouse Creek
originate. (Collection C-26-51 by Cross on Durechon Creek, October 7,
1951.) This suggests downstream reduction in relative numbers of this
species, a tendency which also seemed to exist on both Big Caney River
and Grouse Creek. <i>N. umbratilis</i> was the most abundant species in Big
Caney River except at the lowermost stations where it was surpassed in
relative abundance by <i>N. lutrensis</i> and <i>Gambusia affinis</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p><i>N. umbratilis</i> was a pool-dweller, becoming more concentrated in the
deeper pools as summer advanced. In May and early June, large
concentrations of adult <i>N. umbratilis</i> were common in the shallow ends
of pools together with <i>N. rubellus</i>, <i>N. boops</i>, <i>Pimephales notatus</i>,
and <i>Pimephales tenellus</i>. By July and August, only young of the year
were taken in shallow water, and adults were scarcely in evidence.</p>


<p><b><i>Notropis volucellus</i></b> (Cope): Stations G-5, G-8, C-3, C-5, C-7, C-8,
C-9, C-10, M-1, E-4, E-5.</p>

<p>The mimic shiner was a minor element in the fauna, 2.02 per cent at
station C-5 being the largest percentage taken. In the Big Caney River
system <i>N. volucellus</i> was taken only in the main stream. In the Grouse
Creek drainage it was found at two stations in the upper part of the
watershed, where water is clearer, gradient greater, and pools
well-shaded and cool.</p>

<p>In the Elk River the mimic shiner was taken only in the upper part of
the main stream. The dominant shiner in situations where <i>N. volucellus</i>
was taken was, in all cases, <i>N. umbratilis</i>. Elliott (1947) found <i>N.
volucellus</i> in Spring Creek, a tributary of Fall River. Farther north in
the Flint Hills region, <i>N. volucellus</i> was reported by Cross
(1954a:310).</p>


<p><b><i>Notemigonus crysoleucas</i></b> (Mitchell): Station W-5.</p>

<p>This isolated record for the golden shiner consisted of nine specimens
collected on June 6 in Timber Creek, a tributary of the Walnut River.
Most of the creek was dry. <i>N. crysoleucas</i> was taken in one pool with
dimensions of 8 feet by 4 feet with an average depth of 4 inches. This
creek is sluggish and silt-laden, even under conditions of favorable
precipitation. Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929b:89) observed that the golden
shiner prefers sluggish water. Hall (1952:58) took the golden shiner
only in the lowland tributaries west of Grand River and not east of the
river in upland tributaries.</p>


<p><b><i>Phenacobius mirabilis</i></b> Girard: Stations W-3, C-3.</p>

<p>In no case was the suckermouth minnow common; it never comprised more
than 1 per cent of the fish population.</p>


<p><b><i>Pimephales notatus</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations W-4, G-5, G-7, G-9, G-12,
G-13, B-3, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11,
C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17, C-18, M-1, M-2, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5,
E-7 (J&amp;J, C-131, C-132, C-133).</p>

<p>This was much the most abundant of the four species of <i>Pimephales</i> in
this area. It was taken at 33 stations as compared with 10 for <i>P.
tenellus</i>, 8 for <i>P. promelas</i>, and 3 for <i>P. vigilax</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>The bluntnose minnow was taken almost everywhere except in the main
stream of the Arkansas and Walnut rivers and in lower Grouse Creek. <i>P.
notatus</i> seemed to prefer clearer streams of the Flint Hills part of my
area. There was a marked increase in percentages taken in the upland
tributaries of both Caney River and Grouse Creek. In the Elk River, too,
higher concentrations were found upstream.</p>

<p>The highest relative numbers of bluntnose minnows were taken at station
G-12 on Crab Creek, station C-12 on Cedar Creek and station C-16 on
Spring Creek. At G-12, this minnow was abundant in the deeper isolated
pools. Males in breeding condition were taken on June 9. In Cedar Creek
the population of bluntnose minnows was observed periodically in one
pool in which they were dominant. This pool was 100 feet by 50 feet,
shallow, and with bedrock bottom. At its upper end, however, there was a
small area of heavily-shaded deeper water. Throughout the spring
bluntnose minnows were found in large schools in the shallow area. As
the summer progressed they were no longer there, but seining revealed
their presence in the deeper, upper end.</p>

<p>At station C-16 on Spring Creek on July 9 male <i>P. notatus</i> were taken
in extreme breeding condition, being light brick-red in color and with
large tubercles.</p>


<p><b><i>Pimephales tenellus</i></b> (Girard): Stations G-1, C-2, C-3, C-5, C-6, C-7,
C-8, M-1, E-2, E-4 (C-131 C-133).</p>

<p>The mountain minnow was never taken far from the mainstream of Big
Caney, Middle Caney, or Elk River. In this respect it differed from <i>P.
notatus</i>, which reached large concentrations in the small upland
tributaries. On the other hand, <i>P. tenellus</i> was not so abundant as <i>P.
vigilax</i> in the silty larger streams. In no collection was the mountain
minnow common. The highest percentages were 2.4 per cent (Station C-5),
and 2.1 per cent (Station C-7) on Big Caney River. These stations
consisted of clear, flowing water over rubble bottoms. Males at C-7
(June 16) were in breeding condition.</p>

<p>Moore and Buck (1953:23) reported finding this species among rocks in
very fast water rather than in the quiet backwaters frequented by <i>P.
vigilax</i>. Other records of the mountain minnow from the Flint Hills
indicate that it seeks areas of maximum gradient and flow; in this
distributional respect it is like <i>Notropis camurus</i>. The two species
are recorded together from other streams in this region such as the
Chikaskia (Moore and Buck, 1953:23), Cottonwood (Cross, 1954a:310),
and Spring Creek, tributary of Fall River (Elliott, 1947).
It is conceivable that a preference for flowing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
water might explain its restriction to the medium-sized, less
intermittent streams in this area. The only tributary which the species
seemed to ascend to any extent was Otter Creek, which is seldom
intermittent downstream.</p>


<p><b><i>Pimephales vigilax perspicuus</i></b> (Girard): Stations A-3, C-1, C-4.</p>

<p>The parrot minnow was found only in downstream habitats. Collection C-4
(June 3) on Rock Creek was made about &frac12; mile from the mouth of this
tributary of Big Caney and the creek here had almost the same character
as the river proper. The presence of other channel fishes such as
<i>Ictiobus bubalus</i> indicates the downstream nature of the creek. Some
males of <i>P. vigilax</i> in breeding condition were taken in this
collection.</p>

<p>At C-1, only one specimen was found in a turbid, isolated pool with
bedrock bottom. At A-1 only one parrot minnow was taken; it was in deep,
fairly quiet water near the bank.</p>

<p>Other collections outside the three-county area revealed the following:
In the Neosho River, several parrot minnows were found in quiet
backwaters and in shallow pools. In the Verdigris River three were taken
directly under water spilling over the dam at this station, while others
were found, together with <i>P. promelas</i>, in the mouth of a small creek
that provided a backwater habitat with mud bottom.</p>

<p>Cross and Moore (1952:405) found this species only at stations in the
lower portion of the Poteau River. Farther west the minnow may ascend
the smaller sandy streams to greater distances. Moore and Buck (1953:23)
took parrot minnows at six of 15 stations on the Chikaskia River and
found the species as far upstream as Drury, Kansas. Elliott (1947), in
comparing the South Ninnescah and Spring Creek fish faunas, found only
<i>P. vigilax</i> and <i>P. promelas</i> on the sandy, "flatter" Ninnescah and
only <i>P. notatus</i> and <i>P. tenellus</i> on Spring Creek, an upland, Flint
Hills stream in Greenwood County.</p>


<p><b><i>Pimephales promelas</i></b> Rafinesque: Stations A-2, A-3, W-3, W-4, G-9, B-1,
M-1, E-4 (E&amp;F, C-136).</p>

<p>Occurrences of the fathead minnow were scattered, but included all
streams sampled except Big Caney.</p>

<p>Three of the collections were in small intermittent streams where
conditions were generally unfavorable for fishes and in one instance
extremely foul. Two of these stations had turbid water and all suffered
from siltation.</p>

<p>In Middle Caney Creek the species was rare but in the Elk River
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
(June 28) more than 100 specimens, predominantly young, were taken. This
station consisted of a large isolated pool with a variety of bottom
types. Water was turbid and the surface temperature was high (93&amp;deg; F.).
In different parts of the pool the following numbers of specimens were
taken in single seine-hauls: 15 over shallow bedrock; 35 over gravel
(1&frac12; feet deep); 50 over mud bottom (1 foot deep).</p>

<p><i>P. promelas</i> was found also in the large, flowing rivers: Arkansas,
Walnut, Verdigris, and Neosho. The species was scarce in the Arkansas
River, and was found principally in muddy coves. In the Walnut (W-3),
this minnow comprised 7.65 per cent of the fish taken and was common in
quiet pools.</p>


<p><b><i>Campostoma anomalum</i></b> Rafinesque: Stations W-4, G-4, C-1, C-3, C-5, C-6,
C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17, C-18, B-3
(E&amp;F, C-131, C-136).</p>

<p>Although the stoneroller was found in most streams surveyed, it was
taken most often in the Big Caney system, where it occurred at 16 of the
18 stations. In contrast, it was represented at only one of 17 stations
on Grouse Creek. High percentages were found in three creeks&mdash;Cedar,
Otter, and Spring. As noted above, these streams are normally clear,
swift and have steep gradients and many rubble and gravel riffles. On
these riffles young stonerollers abounded. Station C-16 on Spring Creek
typifies the habitat in which this species was most abundant. The stream
has an average width of 10 feet and depth of a few inches. The volume of
flow was less than 1 cubic foot per second but turbulence was great.
Water was clear and the bottom was gravel and rubble. Following rains in
June, stonerollers quickly occupied parts of Spring Creek (upstream from
C-16) that had been dry throughout the previous winter.</p>

<p>On April 2 many <i>C. anomalum</i> and <i>Etheostoma spectabile</i> were taken in
shallow pools and riffles in an extensive bedrock-riffle area on Cedar
Creek near station C-12. Most of the females were gravid and the males
were in breeding condition. On June 6 these pools were revisited. Flow
had ceased and the pools were drying up. Young-of-the-year of the two
species were abundant, but only a few mature stonerollers were taken. On
August 24, prolonged drought had drastically altered the stream and all
areas from which stonerollers and darters had been taken were dry.
Seining of other pools which were almost dry revealed no stonerollers.</p>

<p>Collections on May 31, June 15, and June 16 in Otter Creek
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
revealed large numbers of stonerollers. They were found in riffle areas, in
aquatic vegetation, and especially in detritus alongside banks. Most of
the specimens were young-of-the-year.</p>

<p><b><i>Anguilla bostoniensis</i></b> (Le Sueur): An American eel was caught by me in
Grouse Creek in 1949.</p>

<p><b><i>Gambusia affinis</i></b> (Baird and Girard): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3, W-1, W-2,
W-3, W-4, W-5, G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5, G-7, G-8, G-9, C-1, C-2, C-3,
C-4, C-6, C-15, E-1.</p>

<p>Mosquitofish occurred widely but in varied abundance. Huge populations
were in the shallow sandy backwaters and cut-off pools of the Arkansas
River. In the shallow pools of several intermittent streams such as
station G-8 on Silver Creek this fish also flourished.</p>

<p><i>G. affinis</i> was taken at every station in the Arkansas, Walnut and
Grouse systems except those stations on two upland tributaries of Grouse
Creek (Crab Creek and Grand Summit Creek). The mosquitofish was not
observed in the clear upland tributaries of Big Caney, nor on upper Big
Caney River itself in May, June, and July. On September 3, however,
<i>Gambusia</i> were taken at station C-15 on Otter Creek and others were
seen at station C-14 on the same date.</p>

<p>Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929b:99) and Cross and Moore (1952:407) observed
that <i>G. affinis</i> usually was absent from small upland tributaries, even
though it was abundant in lower parts of the same river systems.</p>

<p><b><i>Fundulus kansae</i></b> (Garman): Stations A-2, A-3, Evermann and Fordice as
<i>Fundulus zebrinus</i>.</p>

<p>At station A-2, seven plains killifish were taken together with a great
many <i>Notropis deliciosus</i> and <i>Gambusia affinis</i> in a shallow,
algae-covered channel with slight flow and sand bottom. At station A-3
many young killifish were taken in small shallow pools on December 22.
<i>Fundulus kansae</i> has been found in the lower part of the Walnut River
Basin, especially where petroleum pollution was evident. Eastward from
the Walnut River plains killifish have not been taken.</p>

<p><b><i>Fundulus notatus</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations B-1, G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5,
G-7, G-8, G-10, G-11, G-14, C-1, M-1, E-1, Evermann and Fordice as
<i>Zygonectes notatus</i>.</p>

<p>The black-banded topminnow was not taken in the Arkansas River but was
common in the Walnut and Grouse systems. It was common also in Middle
Caney, but in Big Caney and Elk River it was taken only at the lowermost
stations.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>This species did not seem to ascend far into smaller tributaries of
Grouse Creek. In Crab Creek it was taken at the lower two of six
stations and in Grand Summit Creek at the lower of two stations.</p>

<p>The highest relative numbers were taken at stations G-3 (17.5 per cent),
G-4 (24 per cent), G-10 (25.75 per cent) and G-11 (41.52 per
cent), on Crab Creek and Grouse Creek. Both upstream and downstream from
these stations, which were within five miles of each other, the relative
abundance dropped off sharply. The bottoms at these stations were mostly
rubble and mud, and water was turbid at three of the stations. At G-10
(June 24) and G-11 (July 16) young-of-the-year were abundant.</p>

<p><b><i>Ictalurus melas</i></b> (Girard): Stations W-2, W-3, W-4, W-5, B-1, B-2, B-3,
G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5, G-8, G-9, G-11, G-12, G-13, G-14, G-17, C-1,
C-9, C-11, C-12, C-14, C-15, C-17, C-18, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5, E-6, N-1,
Evermann and Fordice as <i>Ameiurus melas</i> (C-133).</p>

<p>The black bullhead was taken at slightly more than half of the stations,
and probably was present at others. Larger numbers were taken in Grouse
Creek than in any other stream system. In many small, shallow pools in
the Grouse Creek system young black bullheads shared dominance with
<i>Gambusia affinis</i> in the late summer. <i>I. melas</i> was also abundant in
isolated pools at the extreme upper ends of Crab Creek, Beaver Creek and
Grand Summit Creek. <i>I. melas</i> was most common in areas with silty
bottoms. The species seemed scarce in the main stream of Big Caney River
but was common in some of its tributaries.</p>

<p><b><i>Pylodictis olivaris</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations A-3, G-1, C-5.</p>

<p>Flathead catfish were taken by angling at stations A-3 and C-5. At
station G-1 (September 5) a flathead catfish five inches long was taken
in the four-foot nylon net.</p>

<p><b><i>Ictalurus punctatus</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations A-3, W-2, W-3, G-2, C-5,
E-4.</p>

<p>Channel catfish from stations W-3, A-3, and C-5 were taken on hook and
line. At station G-2 (August 29) twenty young-of-the-year were seined
from the shallow narrow end of a large pool. All collections of both <i>I.
punctatus</i> and <i>P. olivaris</i> were in the larger streams surveyed.</p>

<p><b><i>Ictalurus natalis</i></b> (LeSueur): Stations G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-8, G-11,
C-12, C-14, C-15.</p>

<p>The yellow bullhead was taken at only 9 stations, compared with 33
stations for the black bullhead. <i>I. natalis</i> was represented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
in 7 of 17 stations in the Grouse Creek system but in only 3 of 18 stations in
the Big Caney system. Of the seven records from Grouse Creek four were
from the main stream. At every station where yellow bullheads were
taken, black bullheads were found also and were abundant, usually
several times more abundant than <i>I. natalis</i>.</p>

<p>At G-11 on Crab Creek (July 16), <i>I. natalis</i> made up 3.8 per cent of
the fish taken. All were young-of-the-year, existing in a tiny, gravelly
pool containing not more than five gallons of water, and were the only
fish present. Young yellow bullheads were also found in small pools with
gravel bottoms at station G-4 on September 7.</p>

<p><b><i>Labidesthes sicculus</i></b> (Cope): Stations G-1, G-2, G-3, G-7, G-10, B-2,
C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-12, E-1, E-2, E-3, E-7, M-1 (E&amp;F, C-131).</p>

<p>The brook silversides was taken, sometimes abundantly, in all stream
systems except the Walnut and Arkansas. At station G-7 on July 8, 41.8
per cent of the fish taken were of this species. <i>L. sicculus</i> was most
abundant in large pools where the bottom was predominantly bedrock and
gravel. The highest concentrations were in the mainstreams of Big Caney,
Grouse, and Elk Rivers. Brook silversides were taken rarely in the
smaller tributaries of these streams.</p>

<p><b><i>Percina phoxocephala</i></b> (Nelson): Stations C-2, C-3, C-5, G-1 (C-133).</p>

<p>Slenderhead darters were scarce, and were found only over gravel
bottoms. Specimens were taken from flowing and quiet water, and from
both shallow and deep water.</p>

<p>Larger numbers of <i>P. phoxocephala</i> were taken by the writer in other
collections made during 1956 on the Neosho and Verdigris Rivers over
bottoms of rubble or gravel. Restriction of this darter to the larger
streams follows a pattern observed by Cross (1954a:313) who noted it was
absent from smaller riffles in minor tributaries. Elliott (1947),
however, took one specimen of <i>P. phoxocephala</i> in Spring Creek, a
tributary of Fall River.</p>

<p><b><i>Percina caprodes carbonaria</i></b> (Baird and Girard): Stations G-3, G-4,
G-7, G-12, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-9, C-12, C-13, C-14 (J&amp;J, C-131, C-133).</p>

<p>The logperch was generally distributed in the Caney, Elk, and Grouse
systems. This species usually comprised less than 1 per cent of the fish
taken; however, at station G-12 it formed 3.76 per cent of the total.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>In many instances the logperch was taken over submerged gravel bars,
often along the edges of the larger pools. At 8 of 13 stations where the
logperch was taken, the golden redhorse was also found. At every station
where logperch were found, <i>Notropis umbratilis</i> was taken and
<i>Pimephales notatus</i> also occurred at all but three of these stations.</p>

<p><b><i>Percina copelandi</i></b> (Jordan): Stations C-4, C-5, C-6, C-8, G-1 (C-131,
C-133, J&amp;J).</p>

<p>Channel darters were collected over bottoms of rubble or gravel, both in
flowing streams and in isolated pools. Although <i>P. copelandi</i> was found
only in Big Caney River and at the lowermost station on Grouse Creek
(G-1) in this survey, this species has been taken previously from Elk
River (K. U. 3463 and K. U. 3197) and from Silver Creek. <i>Notropis
camurus</i> occurred everywhere that <i>H. copelandi</i> was found. In several
instances the two species were taken in the same seine-haul.</p>

<p><b><i>Etheostoma spectabile pulchellum</i></b> (Girard): Stations W-4, G-1, G-4,
G-5, C-6, C-9, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17, C-18, E-1, E-5.
Evermann and Fordice as <i>Etheostoma coeruleum</i> (C-131, C-132).</p>

<p>The habitat preferences of the orangethroat darter seemed similar to
those of <i>Campostoma anomalum</i>. There were sixteen stations at which
both species were taken, seven where only <i>E. spectabile pulchellum</i> was
taken and six where only <i>C. anomalum</i> was taken. The largest relative
numbers of both species were found in the same small, clear upland
tributaries of Big Caney River. On May 31, collections from riffles at
station C-15 (upper Otter Creek) consisted almost entirely of these two
species. On September 1 at this station the stream was intermittent, but
even the tiniest pools abounded with young darters and stonerollers.</p>

<p>Gravid females and males in breeding condition were taken in riffles in
Cedar Creek on April 2. During June numerous young and adult
orangethroat darters were taken in Cedar Creek, in partly decayed leaves
which lined the banks. On June 15 in Otter Creek young darters were
abundant in streamside detritus and in clear, shallow, rubble riffles.
At station C-11 a few darters were taken on rubble riffles; however,
large numbers were found inhabiting thick mats of <i>Potamogeton foliosus</i>
Raf., which grew in shallow water. Many darters (<i>Etheostoma spectabile
pulchellum</i> and <i>Percina phoxocephala</i>) were taken in September along
gravelly banks at stations C-2 and C-3 by disturbing small rocks and
leaf-litter along the shores. Young orangethroat darters seemed to seek
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
out sheltered areas and in some cases were found in sluggish, even
foul, water (Stations W-4, B-1 and G-12). Moore and Buck (1953:26) note
that the orangethroat darter is able to thrive in Oklahoma in rather
sluggish and even intermittent waters which reach quite high summer
temperatures.</p>

<p>Unlike other darters taken in this survey, the orangethroat darter was
common to abundant at several stations and was found at a great many
more stations than any other darter. The comparatively great tolerance
of this species to varying habitats, suggested by this survey, is also
reflected by its widespread distribution in Kansas.</p>

<p><b><i>Micropterus salmoides salmoides</i></b> (Lacepede): Stations B-1, G-4, G-5,
G-7, G-12, C-1, C-3, E-1, E-2, E-3.</p>

<p>Most of the largemouth bass taken were young-of-the-year. In Big Caney
River this species seemed rare, being found at only two downstream
stations compared with eight stations at which <i>M. punctulatus</i> was
taken.</p>

<p>Many ponds in the Flint Hills have been stocked with largemouth bass. At
present largemouth bass are frequently caught by hook and line in Crab
Creek (Station G-12); however, Mr. A. C. Metcalf, who has fished this
stream for approximately 45 years, states that he took no bass in the
creek prior to the building and stocking of large ponds on nearby
ranches.</p>

<p><b><i>Micropterus punctulatus</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7,
C-8, C-10, C-14, C-15, E-2, E-5 (C-133).</p>

<p>The spotted bass was taken only in tributaries of the Verdigris River,
where it seemed more numerous than the preceding species. It has been
reported from other Verdigris tributaries such as Fall River (Elliott,
1947) and is common eastward from the Verdigris Basin. A spotted bass
(K. U. 3467) was taken by Cross on the Little Walnut River in Butler
County on April 5, 1955. This seems to be the only record of this
species from the Walnut River Basin at the present time.</p>

<p><b><i>Pomoxis annularis</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, W-5, G-1, G-2, G-5,
G-10, G-11, G-12, C-1, C-2, C-4, C-5, C-6, M-1, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5
(C-136).</p>

<p>White crappie were found in almost all habitats and were taken in all
rivers except the Arkansas. The relative abundance of this species was
greater at downstream than at upstream stations on Grouse Creek, Big
Caney, and Elk River. Schools of young crappie were frequently found and
the factor of chance in taking or failing to take a school of crappie
prevented confident appraisal of abundance. White crappie usually sought
quiet waters. Often they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
were found in backwaters and many times
schools were taken over bottoms where mud and detritus had been
deposited. It was not uncommon to take <i>Pomoxis annularis</i> and
<i>Ictalurus melas</i> in the same seine-haul in such areas.</p>

<p><b><i>Pomoxis nigromaculatus</i></b> (LeSueur): Station C-1.</p>

<p>Black crappie were taken in Otter Creek on May 29 and September 3.
Several ponds in eastern Cowley County are stocked with black crappie,
but none was taken from streams into which these ponds drain.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepomis cyanellus</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, W-4, W-5, B-1, B-2, B-3,
G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-12, G-13, G-14, G-15, G-16,
G-17, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12,
C-13, C-14, C-16, C-17, C-18, E-1, E-4, E-5, E-6, E-7, M-2 (C-131,
C-132, C-133, C-136, E&amp;F).</p>

<p>The green sunfish was taken at 45 of 60 stations, which is the greatest
number recorded for one species. The only stream from which it was not
obtained was the Arkansas River. Green sunfish constituted a minor but
consistent part of the fauna in Big Caney River except for some
intermittent pools on small tributaries, where it was high in relative
abundance. It usually comprised approximately 4 per cent of the fish
taken at stations on Grouse Creek. In some intermittent tributaries of
Grouse Creek and Elk River percentages also were high.</p>

<p>Funk and Campbell (1953:74) observed that <i>L. cyanellus</i> held a definite
but minor place in all collections made on the Black River in Missouri.
This pattern was also observed by the writer in collections made on the
Neosho and Spring Rivers in southeastern Kansas. This seems to indicate
that the Big Caney River populations (exclusive of the upstream stations
in intermittent streams) follow a pattern commonly found in southeastern
Kansas and probably in the Ozark region.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepomis humilis</i></b> (Girard): Stations A-3, W-2, W-3, W-4, W-5, G-1, G-2,
G-3, G-4, G-5, G-7, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-11, G-12, G-14, G-15, C-1, C-2,
C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-16, C-17,
B-2, B-3, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5, E-6, E-7, M-1. (C-131, C-132, C-133,
C-136, J&amp;J, E&amp;F.)</p>

<p>The orangespotted sunfish was found in every stream surveyed, although
only one specimen was taken from the Arkansas River.</p>

<p>The largest relative number of this species (44.6) was taken at station
G-1. Percentages at other stations on Grouse Creek and its tributaries
progressively declined in an upstream direction.</p>

<p>In Big Caney River representation of <i>L. humilis</i> in collections
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
varied from 1.56 per cent at station C-1 to 23.47 per cent at station
C-7. This sunfish was usually the dominant species in collections made
from the Elk River, where the relative abundance ranged from 10 to 30
per cent.</p>

<p>The orangespotted sunfish is widespread in Kansas and seems to be a
diagnostic constituent of the Plains Fauna. Moore and Buck (1953:26)
found it "very common" in the Chikaskia River in Kansas and Oklahoma.
Cross (1950:140) noted that in Stillwater Creek it seemed to be the most
tolerant and consequently the most abundant of the stream's cent
rarchids. Moore and Paden (1950:91) note that <i>L. humilis</i> is most
common in muddy waters and found in overflow pools, backwaters, and
oxbow lakes. This species is frequently found in farm ponds in the area
surveyed, which further suggests a wide range of habitat tolerance.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepomis megalotis breviceps</i></b> (Baird and Girard): Stations W-3, W-4,
W-5, B-1, B-2, G-1, G-4, G-5, G-7, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-11, G-12, G-13 (all
Big Caney River stations except C-18), E-1, E-2, E-3, E-4, E-5, E-6,
M-1, M-2 (C-131, C-132, C-133, J&amp;J, E&amp;F).</p>

<p>In Big Caney River the longear sunfish shared dominance with the redfin
shiner (<i>Notropis umbratilis</i>) at almost every station. The average of
its relative abundance at all stations in the Big Caney system was 16.5
per cent. It was also abundant at several stations on Grouse Creek and
made up 43.25 per cent of all fish taken at station G-4.</p>

<p>Cross (1950:140) observed that <i>L. megalotis breviceps</i> increased in
Stillwater Creek probably as a result of clearer water and stabilized
water level.</p>

<p>In collections made west of the area treated here (Moore and Buck,
1953:26; Elliott, 1947) the longear sunfish is less abundant than in Big
Caney River and Grouse Creek.</p>

<p><b><i>Lepomis macrochirus</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, G-3, G-4, G-5, C-3,
C-5, E-1, E-2 (C-131, C-132, C-133).</p>

<p>The bluegill was, in all cases, a minor constituent in the fish fauna.
No clear pattern of habitat preference can be deduced. In the Verdigris
River at Independence (collection AM-53, August 22, 1956) bluegills were
common in quiet pools and coves below a low-water dam. Moore and Paden
(1950:91) note that <i>L. macrochirus</i> prefers quiet waters and Hubbs and
Lagler (1947:94) state that it is "generally restricted to the quieter
pools.&quot;</p>

<p>The bluegill is widely-stocked in impoundments of the area treated
here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>


<p><b><i>Aplodinotus grunniens</i></b> (Rafinesque): Stations C-4, E-2.</p>

<p>The dearth of stations from which the freshwater drum is reported may
indicate difficulty in taking this species with seines, rather than
scarcity. Both collections were at downstream stations. At station C-4
three half-grown drum were taken. Fishermen take "drum" at least as far
upstream as station C-5 on Big Caney River. In the Elk River one
specimen was taken in a 20-foot seine below a dam at Elk Falls.</p>

<hr>
<h2>FISHES OF DOUBTFUL OR POSSIBLE OCCURRENCE</h2>

<p>In addition to the species listed above, the following species have been
reported nearby and may occur within the area surveyed.</p>

<p><i>Lepisosteus productus</i> (Cope)&mdash;This gar has not been reported from
Kansas. It has been taken at several points in the northern half of
Oklahoma and as far west as Canton Reservoir by Buck and Cross (1951). A
specimen of the spotted gar was taken by Elkin (1954:28) in Salt Creek
in Osage County, Oklahoma.</p>

<p><i>Polyodon spathula</i> (Walbaum)&mdash;The paddlefish has never been reported
from the Arkansas River system in Kansas. Several reports by fishermen
were traced by the writer, but authentication was not achieved. One
mounted specimen was examined in a sporting goods store in Arkansas
City. This fish was said to have been taken on the Arkansas River south
of Arkansas City but information on the date and method of capture were
vague. Mr. Darrell Wheat of Arkansas City reported taking four
paddlefish below a dam at Oxford, Kansas, in 1948 and 1949.</p>

<p><i>Hiodon alosoides</i> (Rafinesque)&mdash;One specimen (K. U. 3095) of the
goldeye was taken in 1953 on the Arkansas River near Oxford in Sumner
County. Fishermen also report taking this fish occasionally in the
Walnut River in Cowley County.</p>

<p><i>Noturus flavus</i> (Rafinesque)&mdash;The stonecat was taken in the Verdigris
system by R. D. Lindsay in 1911 (K. U. 2058) and more recently by Cross
in Montgomery County (C-120) and Schelske (1957:46) in Wilson and
Montgomery Counties. The close proximity of these collection areas to
lower portions of the Elk River indicate probable occurrence in Elk
River and other Verdigris tributaries.</p>

<p><i>Noturus nocturnus</i> (Jordan and Gilbert)&mdash;The freckled madtom has been
taken on all sides of the area studied making its occurrence therein
highly probable. This madtom has been taken in Beaver
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Creek in Osage County, Oklahoma (OAM 4771); from a tributary of the Walnut River in
Sedgwick County by Cross (1954); from the Chikaskia River (Moore and
Buck, 1953:24); and from several localities on the Verdigris River
(Schelske, 1957:47).</p>

<p><i>Etheostoma cragini</i> (Gilbert)&mdash;One Cragin's darter (K. U. 3470) was
taken by Cross in the Arkansas River near the Sumner-Cowley county line
(Sec. 25, T31S, R2E). Records of this darter are few and widely
scattered geographically. Several collections from north-eastern
Oklahoma are noted by Moore and Cross (1950:144).</p>

<p><i>Etheostoma whipplii</i> (Girard)&mdash;Schelske (1957:38) reports the redfin
darter from the Verdigris River three miles southeast of Benedict,
Kansas. Dr. George Moore of Oklahoma A. &amp; M. College states that it has
been taken in the Verdigris drainage in Oklahoma at several locations.</p>

<p><i>Etheostoma zonale arcansanum</i> (Jordan and Gilbert)&mdash;Two banded darters
(K. U. 3213) have been reported by Schelske (1957:49) from Fall River
near Neodesha, Kansas. Because a tributary of Fall River enters Elk
County its presence in this and other Verdigris tributaries in the area
seems possible. This darter has been reported from only one other stream
in Kansas, Shoal Creek in Cherokee County, where it has been collected
often.</p>

<p><i>Roccus chrysops</i> (Rafinesque)&mdash;The white bass has been stocked in Hulah
Reservoir on Big Caney River in Oklahoma. To date it has not been
reported from the Big Caney in Kansas. White bass are common in many
reservoirs of Kansas and Oklahoma and have been taken in rivers in both
states. Mr. Clement Gillespie of Arkansas City, Kansas Forestry, Fish
and Game Commission wildlife protector for the area, states that two
hundred young of <i>R. chrysops</i> were released in Grouse Creek several
years ago under auspices of the Commission. The fish has not been
reported by fishermen since that time to the knowledge of Mr. Gillespie
or of the writer.</p>

<p><i>Lepomis microlophus</i> (Gunther)&mdash;One redear sunfish was taken on Salt
Creek in Osage County, Oklahoma, by Elkin (1954:28). Because this
species has been stocked widely in Oklahoma its eventual occurrence in
Kansas seems probable.</p>

<p><i>Chaenobryttus gulosus</i> (Cuvier)&mdash;The warmouth has been taken south of
the collection area in Osage County on Salt Creek by Elkin (1954:28).</p>


<hr>
<h2>FAUNAL COMPARISONS OF DIFFERENT STREAMS</h2>

<p>The faunas of Elk River, Big Caney River, and Grouse Creek were
generally similar. These streams and most of their tributaries originate
in the same hilly area of eastern Cowley County and western
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Elk and Chautauqua counties; their similarities and differences have been
pointed out.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Labidesthes sicculus</i></span><br>
</p>

<p>No species was found in Elk River to the exclusion of Big Caney and
Grouse Creek. Fish taken exclusively in Grouse Creek were <i>Ictiobus
cyprinella</i> at station G-2 and <i>Notropis percobromus</i> at station G-1.
The following species were taken only in Big Caney River: <i>Ictiobus
niger</i>, <i>Notropis rubellus</i>, <i>Phenacobius mirabilis</i>, <i>Pimephales
vigilax</i>, and <i>Pomoxis nigromaculatus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Notropis buchanani</i> and <i>Pimephales promelas</i> were taken in Grouse
Creek and Elk River, but not in Big Caney River, although the watershed
of Big Caney lies largely between these two streams. Three species,
<i>Notropis camurus</i>, <i>Micropterus punctulatus</i>, and <i>Aplodinotus
grunniens</i>, were found in Elk River and Big Caney but not in Grouse
Creek. <i>Ictalurus natalis</i>, <i>Pylodictis olivaris</i>, and <i>Percina
phoxocephala</i> were taken in Big Caney River and Grouse Creek but not in
Elk River. <i>Percina copelandi</i> was taken by Cross on Elk River in 1954
and 1955 (K. U. 3464 and K. U. 3197).</p>

<p>Forty species were taken in Big Caney River, 35 in Grouse Creek and 31
in Elk River. Collections were made from only six stations on Elk River
as compared with 18 from Big Caney and 17 from Grouse Creek.</p>

<p>Twenty-four species were taken in the Walnut River system, only one of
which (<i>Notemigonus crysoleucas</i>) was taken exclusively there.</p>

<p>In the Arkansas River 18 species were found, four of which did not occur
elsewhere. These were <i>Hybopsis aestivalis</i>, <i>Notropis blennius</i>, <i>N.
girardi</i>, and <i>Fundulus kansae</i>.</p>

<h2>DISTRIBUTIONAL VARIATIONS WITHIN THE SAME STREAM</h2>


<p>An analysis of faunal variations in different parts of the same stream
system was made for Big Caney River and Grouse Creek. Collecting was
more extensive in these streams, and sampling was done over a wider
range of habitat, than in the Arkansas and Walnut rivers.</p>

<p>The fish taken in the first five seine hauls at each station were
counted and the number of each species was recorded as a percentage of
the total number of fish taken. These percentages were calculated for
the main stream and for each tributary in an attempt to discern possible
intra-stream faunal patterns. In Table 6 lower, middle, and upper
segments of each stream have been segregated and the average of all
stations within each segment is shown.</p>

<p>The results are subject to several sources of error, some of which are
discussed below:</p>

<p>(1) Seining techniques could not be entirely standardized. One station
might present a series of long narrow riffles and narrow, shallow pools
in which only a small seine could be used effectively; another station
might consist of a large, deep, isolated pool in which a larger seine
was needed for effective sampling. In practice, the five seine hauls
were made with any of several seines ranging from ten to twenty feet in
length.</p>

<p>(2) Seines are species-selective, due partly to the preference of
certain fishes for special habitat niches. Fishes that are often found
under stones or in weedy pools require special collecting techniques and
frequently were not represented in the initial five hauls. If work
subsequent to the first five hauls indicated that such fish were a
prominent part of the fauna at a particular station, these results were
considered before percentages were calculated.</p>

<p>(3) Temporal variations occur in populations at the same station. There
were both seasonal and diurnal differences in relative numbers of
species taken in these collections. This was noted especially at station
C-5 where collecting was done both at night and by day. Spawning by
certain species during the course of the study complicated estimates of
their relative abundance.</p>

<p>(4) In tabulating percentages of fishes obtained an arbitrary element is
often unavoidable in deciding whether a station, especially a station on
a tributary, should be considered as part of the lower, middle, or upper
segment of a river system.</p>

<p>Despite these disadvantages it is felt that table 6 has factual basis
permitting some reliable interpretation.</p>

<h4><i>Big Caney River</i></h4>

<p>The "lower segment" of Big Caney River is immediately upstream from
Hulah Reservoir, and is not the lowermost portion of the entire river
basin, but merely the lower part of the river in the area studied. A
conspicuous characteristic of the lower segment was the general
restriction of the deep-bodied suckers and the carp to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
this part of the
stream. Other fishes that were most common in the lower section were
<i>Pimephales vigilax</i>, <i>Percina phoxocephala</i>, <i>Gambusia affinis</i>, and
<i>Aplodinotus grunniens</i>. <i>Labidesthes sicculus</i> and <i>Lepisosteus osseus</i>
ranged into the middle section of the stream, but were present in larger
numbers downstream. <i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>, <i>Pomoxis annularis</i>, and
<i>Lepomis macrochirus</i> were taken chiefly in downstream habitats;
however, stocking has confused the distributional pattern of these
species. <i>Notropis lutrensis</i>, although found throughout the system,
progressively declined in numbers taken in the middle and upper
sections. Approximately 18 species were usually taken in downstream
collections.</p>

<p>No species were found exclusively in the middle section of the Big Caney
system. <i>Micropterus punctulatus</i>, <i>Notropis umbratilis</i>, and <i>Lepomis
megalotis</i> tended to be most common in the middle section of the main
stream. These three species were taken together at stations C-5, C-6,
C-8, and C-10.</p>

<p>The upper section yielded no species that did not occur also in another
section. Fishes most abundant in the upper section included: <i>Campostoma
anomalum</i>, <i>Etheostoma spectabile</i>, <i>Notropis boops</i>, <i>Notropis
rubellus</i>, <i>Pimephales notatus</i>, and <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i>. <i>Ictalurus
natalis</i> also seemed more common upstream than in lower parts of the
basin.</p>

<p><i>Campostoma anomalum</i> was one of the most common fishes taken at many of
the stations on small upland tributaries. In downstream collections its
relative abundance was less, although it was often concentrated on
riffles.</p>

<p>In the Big Caney system as a whole <i>Notropis umbratilis</i> was the most
abundant species. Several species were present throughout the system in
proportions varying, sometimes greatly, from station to station.
<i>Lepomis megalotis</i> and <i>Lepomis humilis</i> were erratic in occurrence,
and the numbers of <i>Notropis camurus</i> and <i>Ictalurus melas</i> varied
without pattern.</p>


<h4><i>Grouse Creek</i></h4>

<p>The fauna of the main stream of Grouse Creek fluctuated more in number
and kinds of fish from station to station than did the fauna of Big
Caney River. Again, the deep-bodied suckers showed downstream
proclivities. In addition, <i>Notropis buchanani</i>, <i>Pimephales tenellus</i>,
<i>Percina copelandi</i>, <i>Percina phoxocephala</i>, <i>Notropis percobromus</i> and
<i>Pylodictis olivaris</i> were taken only at the lowermost station (G-1). At
stations G-2 and G-3 the creek is sluggish and often turbid, meandering
between high mud banks in a flood plain. At these stations <i>Fundulus
notatus</i>, <i>Gambusia affinis,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
<i>Labidesthes sicculus</i>, <i>Ictalurus
melas,</i> and <i>Lepomis humilis</i> were the most common fishes. Shiners
(<i>Notropis</i> spp.) and <i>Lepomis megalotis</i> were rarely taken. Hall
(1953:36) states that <i>Gambusia affinis</i>, <i>Fundulus notatus</i>, and
<i>Labidesthes sicculus</i> are usually associated with overflow pools,
oxbows, and vegetated backwaters.</p>

<p>Those fishes mentioned in the preceding paragraph remained common in the
middle section of the stream. In addition <i>Notropis lutrensis</i>,
<i>Notropis umbratilis</i>, and <i>Lepomis megalotis</i> were important members of
the fauna.</p>

<p>In the uppermost section shiners (<i>Notropis</i> spp.) were common. In the
few upstream stations that were still in good condition with clear
flowing water, the fauna resembled that of the upstream stations on Big
Caney River. Most upstream stations on Grouse Creek were located on
highly intermittent streams that are treated below.</p>

<hr>
<h2>FAUNAS OF INTERMITTENT STREAMS</h2>

<p>Because of severe, protracted drought, most of the streams studied had
ceased to flow by the close of the survey period. However, the duration
of intermittency varied greatly in different streams, as did its effect
in terms of the number and sizes of residual pools, water temperatures,
pollution, and turbidity. Crab Creek, Beaver Creek, and a small unnamed
tributary of Grouse Creek were severely affected by intermittency. Their
faunas are discussed below.</p>

<p>In Crab Creek six collections were made from points near the mouth to
the uppermost pool in which water was found. Pools near the mouth were
as large as thirty feet in width and ninety feet in length, while those
that were uppermost were shallow puddles averaging ten feet in length
and five feet in width. The uppermost station was situated in bluestem
pasture without benefit of shade from trees.</p>

<p>The species taken and their relative abundances based on five seine
hauls at each station are shown in Table 7. At the uppermost pool (G-17)
only small green sunfish were found. At G-16, next downstream, this
species was joined by large numbers of black bullheads and a few redfin
shiners and red shiners. G-13 was similar to G-16, but two additional
species occurred there. G-12 was a clear, deep pool much larger than any
at the stations upstream. Here, seven species were added to the fauna,
and the percentages of <i>Ictalurus melas</i> and <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i> were
much less. At G-10 <i>Fundulus notatus</i>, <i>Labidesthes sicculus</i>, and
<i>Minytrema</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
<i>melanops</i> appeared. Nevertheless, fewer species (10) were captured here
than at station G-12 upstream.</p>

<p>A series of collections similar to that on Crab Creek was carried out
along 1&frac12; miles of Beaver Creek on July 22, 1956. Nine pools were
sampled (Table 8) of which number nine was the uppermost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
point where water was found (except for farm ponds). Mainly young of <i>Lepomis
cyanellus</i> and <i>Ictalurus melas</i> were found in the uppermost stations,
as on Crab Creek. Only adults of <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> and <i>Notropis
umbratilis</i> were taken.</p>

<p>In another small intermittent tributary of Grouse Creek two collections
(G-14 and G-15) were made. One was from several isolated pools near the
source of the creek and the other was 1&frac12; miles upstream from the
mouth. The two stations were approximately four miles apart. Table 9
indicates approximate percentages of fish taken in five seine hauls at
these stations.</p>

<p>At two other stations, only <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i> was found. One of these
stations consisted of several small spring-fed pools in a dry arroyo
tributary to Little Beaver Creek. Around these small "oases" rushes and
smartweeds grew and blackbirds were nesting in the rushes. Although
green sunfish up to eight inches in length were common in the shallow
pools, no other species was found. The second station (C-17) on the East
Fork Big Caney River is of special interest. The pool was isolated, had
dimensions of about 25&times;25 feet, and had an average depth of 15 inches.
The water was foul; cows had been fed fodder in a sheltered area above
the pool during the preceding winter and the entire bottom was covered
to a depth of 6 inches to 1 foot with a detritus of decomposing fodder,
cattle feces, and leaves. The water became almost inky in consistency
when the bottom was stirred and its odor was offensive. A thick
gray-green bloom lay on the surface. This bloom was full of bubbles
indicating gases rising from the bottom muds. One hundred fifty-three
green sunfish, all less than 5 inches in length, were taken in one
seine-haul at this station.</p>

<h2>EAST-WEST DISTRIBUTION</h2>

<p>In the Arkansas River system in Kansas there are marked differences
between fish faunas of the western and eastern parts of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
state. This can be illustrated by comparison of Spring River in Cherokee County with
the Cimarron River in southwestern Kansas. Single collections from
Spring River or its tributaries usually contain 25 or more species of
fish. Collections from the Cimarron rarely contain more than five or six
species. Many of those fishes found in Spring River are characteristic
of an Ozarkian fauna, and some are endemic to the Ozark uplands. Fish
found in the Cimarron or Arkansas in western Kansas are members of a
plains fauna of wide distribution. There is mingling of these two faunal
groups across the state, with the number of Ozarkian species diminishing
westward, and certain plains species diminishing eastward. A number of
species such as <i>Moxostoma duquesnii</i> and <i>Notropis spilopterus</i> are
limited, on the basis of present records, to Spring River and its
tributaries in Kansas. Others have not been taken west of the Neosho
drainage. The Verdigris River provides the next major avenue of westward
dispersal followed by Caney River, Grouse Creek, and the Walnut River.
West of the Walnut River system Ozarkian species have been almost always
absent from collections. The Chikaskia River is somewhat exceptional.
Moore and Buck (1953) reported from this river several species that seem
more typical of eastern faunal associations. Table 10 indicates the
stream system in which the present westernmost records are located for a
number of fishes found in the Arkansas River system in Kansas.</p>

<p>The easternmost occurrences of four species are in the area studied.
These species are <i>Hybopsis aestivalis tetranemus</i> (Station A-2),
<i>Notropis blennius</i> (Station A-1), <i>Notropis girardi</i> (Station A-2), and
<i>Fundulus kansae</i> (Station A-2 and Walnut River). These fish are
associated with the Arkansas River proper and its sandy western
tributaries. In Oklahoma, these fish are found in the Arkansas River as
it proceeds eastward and in the downstream portions of some of its
tributaries. These fish show little tendency to ascend the streams of
the Flint Hills.</p>


<hr>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>The fish fauna of the area studied is transitional between the Ozarkian
and Great Plains faunas.</p>

<p>Fluctuation in water level seemed especially important in determining
distribution of fishes in the area studied. Variable climate
characteristic of the region studied causes recurrent floods and
intermittency in streams. Both of these conditions have probably been
accentuated by man's modifications of the habitat. The effects of
intermittency were most strikingly demonstrated in small creeks of the
uplands. The number of species of fish in the highly intermittent
streams was small&mdash;especially in the uppermost pools sampled&mdash;but the
actual number of fish was often high even though the number of species was low.
In several instances the only fishes found in these isolated pools were <i>Lepomis
cyanellus</i> and <i>Ictalurus melas</i>. This phenomenon of concentrated
numbers of individuals of a few species would indicate the presence of limiting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
factors that allow only those species most tolerant of the particular factor
to flourish.</p>

<p>Soon after rains restored flow in these intermittent creeks <i>L.
cyanellus</i> and <i>I. melas</i> appeared in parts of the channels that had
previously been several miles from the nearest water. Rapid upstream
movements of other species after rains was also noted.</p>

<p>It was impossible to ascertain the precise effects of gradient and
bottom-type on distribution, but certain species such as <i>Notropis
blennius</i>, <i>Notropis girardi</i>, and <i>Fundulus kansae</i> were taken only in
streams with sandy bottoms. <i>Notropis deliciosus</i> and <i>Hybognathus
placita</i> were most abundant over sandy bottoms.</p>

<p>The high gradient of upland tributaries in the Flint Hills area produced
turbulence and bottoms predominantly of rubble. A fauna of which
<i>Etheostoma spectabile</i> and <i>Campostoma anomalum</i> were characteristic
existed in these waters while they were flowing. As flow decreased and
intermittency commenced, qualitative and quantitative changes in the
fish faunas were observed. Gradient did not change during drought, but
turbulence did. Because turbulence varies with water level as well as
gradient, the effect of gradient on fish distribution ultimately is
linked to climate.</p>

<p>Probably the small number of fish taken on the Walnut River in
comparison with other eastern Kansas rivers (Verdigris, Neosho) results,
in part, from the long-term pollution of the stream noted by Clapp
(1920:33) and Doze (1924). No percid fishes, black bass, or madtom
catfish were taken on the Walnut in Cowley County and the species of
<i>Notropis</i> numbered only three.</p>

<p>Four faunal associations seem to be recognizable in the area.</p>


<h4><i>Arkansas River Fauna</i></h4>

<p>This fauna contained <i>Notropis girardi</i>, <i>Notropis blennius</i>, <i>Hybopsis
aestivalis tetranemus</i>, and <i>Fundulus kansae</i> which, in this area, did
not seem to wander far from the sandy main stream of the Arkansas.
Minnows abounded; <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> and <i>N. deliciosus missuriensis</i>
predominated; and <i>Notropis girardi</i>, <i>N. percobromus</i>, and <i>Hybognathus
placita</i> were common. In quiet backwaters, coves, and shallow pools
<i>Gambusia affinis</i> occurred in great numbers. <i>Lepisosteus osseus</i>
seemed to be the most important predator.</p>


<h4><i>Lower Walnut River Fauna</i></h4>

<p>The Walnut River in Cowley County supported large populations of
deep-bodied suckers, carp, and gar. <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> and <i>N.
percobromus</i> were characteristic minnows. <i>Lepomis</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
<i>humilis</i> abounded at some stations. The fauna of the main stream of the
Walnut River was somewhat intermediate between that of the Arkansas River and
that of the three streams considered below. Fifteen of the species common to the
Big Caney, Elk, and Grouse systems were also taken in the Walnut River main
stream. Thirteen species were common to the Walnut and Arkansas rivers.
Seven species were common to all these streams.</p>


<h4><i>Caney-Elk-Grouse Main Stream Fauna</i></h4>

<p>This fauna includes fishes living not only in the main streams but also
in the lower parts of the larger tributaries of these streams. The fauna
was comparatively rich: in the main stream of Big Caney River 39 species
were taken, in Grouse Creek 35 species, in the Walnut River main stream
21 species, and in the Arkansas River 19 species. It has been pointed
out that large rivers such as the Walnut and Arkansas have been
subjected to greater direct and indirect modification by man, possibly
resulting in a less diverse fauna than would otherwise occur in these
streams. At present, there is a paucity of ecological niches in the
upland tributaries and large rivers, as compared with streams of
intermediate size. Fishes typical of the Caney-Elk-Grouse association
were <i>Notropis umbratilis</i>, <i>Lepomis megalotis</i>, <i>Lepomis humilis</i>,
<i>Labidesthes sicculus</i>, <i>Fundulus notatus</i>, and the two species of
<i>Micropterus (Micropterus punctulatus</i> was not taken in Grouse Creek).</p>


<h4><i>Upland Tributary Fauna</i></h4>

<p>Tributary faunas were divisible into two categories: (1) Those of the
Walnut River and Grouse Creek (intermittency was severe, species were
few, with <i>Ictalurus melas</i> and <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i> predominating); (2)
those of Big Caney River (stream-flow was more stable, and eastern
fishes, some of which have Ozarkian affinities, occurred in greater
abundance than in any other part of the area surveyed). In the latter
streams <i>Campostoma anomalum</i> and <i>Etheostoma spectabile</i> usually were
dominant. <i>Pimephales notatus</i>, <i>Notropis volucellus</i>, <i>N. camurus</i>, <i>N.
boops</i>, and <i>N. rubellus</i> characteristically occurred. <i>Notropis
lutrensis</i> was sparsely represented in flowing tributaries. <i>Notropis
umbratilis</i>, which seems to prefer habitats intermediate between those
of <i>Notropis lutrensis</i> and Ozarkian shiners, was usually represented.
Deep-bodied suckers and carp were not taken in upland tributaries but
<i>Moxostoma erythrurum</i> was common and <i>Minytrema melanops</i> was taken.</p>

<p>The kinds and numbers of shiners (<i>Notropis</i>) taken at different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
points along Grouse Creek seem significant. <i>N. lutrensis</i> and <i>N. umbratilis</i>
occurred throughout the stream but were rare in sluggish areas where
populations of <i>Gambusia affinis</i>, <i>Fundulus notatus</i>, and <i>Labidesthes
sicculus</i> flourished. At the lowermost station <i>Notropis percobromus</i>
and <i>N. buchanani</i> were taken; these were not present in other
collections. In the uppermost stations where water remained plentiful,
<i>N. boops</i> and <i>N. volucellus</i> were taken, and <i>N. rubellus</i> has been
recorded.</p>

<p>In the broader distributional sense those fishes that seemed most
tolerant of intermittency (<i>Lepomis cyanellus</i>, <i>Lepomis humilis</i>,
<i>Ictalurus melas</i>, <i>Notropis lutrensis</i>) are widely distributed in the
Arkansas River Basin, and are common in the western part of the Arkansas
River Basin. Species less tolerant of intermittency are <i>Notropis
boops</i>, <i>Notropis camurus</i>, <i>Notropis rubellus</i>, <i>Notropis volucellus</i>,
and <i>Pimephales tenellus</i>; they have not been taken far west of the area
studied, and become more common east of it.</p>
